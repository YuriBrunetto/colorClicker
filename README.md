# About the game
The meaning of this game is simple: reach the white color. You start with the black color: rgb(0, 0, 0); and you will have to reach: rgb(255, 255, 255). You can achieve that by clicking a lot and purchasing upgrades that gives to you points in colors and fragments of colors without you even click! Awesome, huh?!
